# CS410 Into to Web Development Final Project

## About the Website

This professional website is part of my final project for CS410 - Intro to Web Development to utilize and implement the different technologies covered in the course. The website will highlight information about myself as well as list some of my previous work and projects.

## How to Run the Code

To run the code/view the website, you can either clone the repository and deploy the website using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension or view the website directly  through the deployed site (Github Pages) here: https://halitran.github.io/

Note: Certain photos on the page may not load due to strange browser behavior and I found that clearing caches and cookies usually works!
