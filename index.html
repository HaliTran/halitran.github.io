          <h3>Portland, Oregon</h3>
          <!--FIX PROFESSIONAL BIO A LITTLE BIT!!-->
          <p>
            Hi, my name Hali and I'm currently a junior at Portland State
            University studying Computer Science while also working as a Quality
            Assurance Engineer Intern at Trimble Viewpoint, a Portland local
            construction software company. With a knack for creatively and
            problem solving, computer science was the perfect career path that
            combined the best of these two worlds and ever since realizing this,
            it has been my field of study. As someone who is always curious and
            exploring new things, I have a wide range of hobbies outside of tech
            which include photography, filmmaking, sports, language, and
            fashion. Although I'm still currently exploring the many different
            sectors of computer science to find out what I truly want to pursue,
            I will continue to expand my knowledge and integrate every piece of
            my learning to find the answer.

        <h3>Braganza Tea</h3>
        <p>
          A basic design project to redesign Braganza Tea's website homepage.
          Braganza Tea is a bubble tea shop located in Portland which I visit
          frequently. However, after discovering that it had a very unappealing
          and mundane website design, I took it as an opportunity for me to get
          creative and apply the learning I had obtained in web design. As I
          challenge, my goal was to to make it look a bit more professional and
          elegant using my limited knowledge of design.

          Specifically, Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts was to gain a familarity with

          main monster boss with your own collections of monsters, each with
          their own unique abilities. Monster Game was created to experience and
          begin implementing operator overloading with object oriented
          programming and abstract data types so that the application can treat
          it as part of the language.
